# Automatic License Plate Recognition using OCR

How have I collected data?
I have used data from the scratch that is available publicly for general purpose, especially for training machine learning models
Link: https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download_v7.html

Steps to run the model:

For easy to implement and run the model directly, I have created the single model file that contains the trained model with ".h5" format.

1. Download/clone this project
2. Download all the required libaries: opencv, tensorflow, tensorboard, pytorch, easyocr (all must be latest downloads as per the compatability)
3. Open the .ipynb python file for the complete code.
4. You can predict the same using others images just by changing the input image name in the code.
